--- layout: more_about_ashraful title: More about Myself permalink: /more_about_me/ subtitle: email- ashrafulhossainwork@gmail.com Hey there ðŸ‘‹ I am Computer Science and Engineering graduate with an active interest on topics related to **Deep learning**, **Computer Vision** and **Robotics**. Right now, Iâ€™m working as a (voluntary) Research Assistant at [AMIRLab](https://amirl.org/) where I am advised by [Dr. Mohammad Firoz Mridha](https://www.aiub.edu/faculty-list/faculty-profile?q=firoz.mridha#firoz.mridha@aiub.edu). I am mainly tasked with classification, segmentation related stuff. I prefer working on real-world applications. I like building stuff, testing ideas and seeing how concepts actually play out when used in practice. I am also mentored by [SM Nurruzaman Nobel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iamnobel/?originalSubdomain=my). He has been a big influence on my growth as a researcher and been guiding me since day 1. -These days, Iâ€™m spending time reviewing core ML, DL and CV concepts to better prepare myself for the future I vision to live. -In my free time, I like to share my learning journey through blogs and YouTube videos ðŸŽ¥. Sometimes it's about research, sometimes coding tips and yes, sometimes just random fun stuff too ðŸ˜„. Apart from all this, I also help my dad run his business. I manage the finances, keep track of inventory. Itâ€™s unrelated to tech, but itâ€™s taught me a lot about staying organized and thinking clearly when solving practical problems. This has become a major part of my life and I enjoy every second of it. Oh â€” when Iâ€™m not working or learning, Iâ€™m probably playing video games, planning my next trip (I've traveled to 5 countries so far!). I love interacting with people from different culture, traditions, belief and try to make meaningful conversation to understand them.
