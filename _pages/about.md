Hey there 👋

-I’m a Computer Science graduate with a growing passion for Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and Robotics. Right now, I’m working as a (voluntary) Research Assistant at AMIRLab, where I’m fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Mohammad Firoz Mridha](https://www.aiub.edu/faculty-list/faculty-profile?q=firoz.mridha#firoz.mridha@aiub.edu). I’ve been involved in some really exciting research around DL and CV, and even got to contribute to a few projects and papers (two published so far, others under review 🤞).

-I’m also deeply thankful to [SM Nurruzaman Nobel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iamnobel/?originalSubdomain=my), my research mentor, who’s played a big role in shaping my journey in this field.

-Alongside research, I’m revisiting and sharpening my core concepts in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Computer Vision — always trying to level up my understanding.

-In my free time, I like to share what I learn through blogs and YouTube videos — sometimes educational, sometimes just random fun stuff 😄.

Apart from all this, I also help my dad run his business — I manage the finances, keep track of inventory, and try to stay on top of things. It’s not directly related to tech, but it’s taught me a lot about responsibility, organization, and real-world problem-solving.

Oh — and when I’m not working or learning, I’m probably playing video games, planning my next trip (I've traveled to 5 countries so far!), or just enjoying discovering new cultures 🌍.
